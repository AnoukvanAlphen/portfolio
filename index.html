                <h2>Anouk van Alphen</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Bachelor of Computing student specializing in Software Engineering, with a growing interest in
                    cloud computing and networking. I love digging into how systems work and how they can be optimized
                    to solve real-world problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m always open to new learning opportunities and thrive in environments where I can adapt, grow,
                    and take on fresh
                    challenges. Whether it's diving into a new technology or stepping into unfamiliar territory, I enjoy
                    the process of
                    figuring things out and expanding my skill set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside my technical interests, I’ve always had a creative side. I’m a trained ballerina,
                    contemporary dancer and
                    visual artist, and I find that my artistic background brings a fresh perspective to how I approach
                    problem-solving and
                    design.

                <h3>Student Council President</h3>
                <h4>Belgium Campus iTversity, Stellenbosch Campus — 2025</h4>
                <p>
                    As President of the Student Council at the Belgium Campus ITVersity Stellenbosch campus, I take a
                    hands-on and highly
                    involved approach to leadership. I work closely with my team to ensure strong collaboration, open
                    communication, and
                    personal growth for each member.
                </p> <br>
                <h5>Some of my responsibilities include:</h5>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>Leading and facilitating weekly student stand-up meetings</li>
                    <li>Actively supporting my team in their individual responsibilities and initiatives</li>
                    <li>Organizing and delegating tasks while remaining involved throughout execution</li>
                    <li>Acting as a liaison between students and faculty to address concerns and ideas</li>
                    <li>Creating opportunities for leadership development within the team</li>
                    <li>Fostering a vibrant, inclusive, and engaging student life</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This role has allowed me to grow in my leadership and learn essential people skills. I pride myself
                    on my ability to not
                    only support and lead my team, but to help each individual experience the same personal and
                    professional growth by
                    acknowledging their soft skills and pushing them to take initiative.
